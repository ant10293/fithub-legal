The following is excerpted from our [Terms of Service](/terms/).

## 6. Health and Safety Disclaimer

FitHub offers fitness tracking and informational tools. It does not provide medical advice or diagnoses. Consult a physician before starting any exercise program. Use the App at your own risk and discontinue use if you experience pain, dizziness, or other concerning symptoms.

## 6.1 Fitness Calculations, Estimates, and Recommendations

FitHub provides workout recommendations, set details (including weight and rep schemes), and progression suggestions that rely on calculations and estimates. You acknowledge and agree that:

- **One-Rep Max (1RM) and Derived Values:** The App uses formulas (including percentage-based 1RM calculations) to suggest loads and set parameters. These are estimates only and may not reflect your actual capabilities or optimal training loads.

- **Estimates Without Performance Data:** When you have not logged performance data for an exercise, the App may use population-based estimates, formulas, or other heuristics to generate suggestions. These estimates are not personalized to you and may be inaccurate.

- **Progressive Overload and Forced Progression:** The App may apply automatic or suggested progression (e.g., increasing weight or intensity over time). Such recommendations are algorithmic and do not account for your individual recovery, fatigue, injury history, or other factors. You are responsible for adjusting or ignoring progression when appropriate.

- **No Guarantee of Results or Safety:** Calculations, estimates, and recommendations are provided for informational purposes only. They do not constitute professional fitness, medical, or nutritional advice. FitHub does not guarantee that following its suggestions will produce any particular result or that they are safe for you. You assume all risk associated with your use of the App's recommendations.
