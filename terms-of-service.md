## 1. Acceptance

These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the FitHub mobile application and related services (“App”). By creating an account or using the App, you agree to these Terms and to our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, you must stop using the App.

## 2. Eligibility

FitHub is available to users of any age. If you are under 13, a parent or legal guardian must review these Terms and provide any required consent. If you access the App on behalf of a minor, you agree to these Terms for that minor and accept responsibility for their use.

## 3. Account Registration and Security

You must provide accurate and complete information when creating an account and keep it current. You are responsible for safeguarding your login credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. Notify us immediately at [support@fithub-app.com](mailto:support@fithub-app.com) if you suspect unauthorized access.

## 4. Subscription and Billing

Some features may require a paid subscription (“Premium”).

- Pricing, billing cycles, and renewal terms are shown at purchase.
- Premium plans automatically renew until canceled through your App Store/Play Store account or within your settings.
- We may change pricing with reasonable prior notice; changes apply to the next billing cycle.
- Refunds follow the policies of the platform used for purchase (e.g., Apple App Store, Google Play).

## 5. User Content

FitHub does not host community feeds or public user-generated content. The information you provide—such as account details, support messages, or other direct submissions—remains yours. We handle it solely to deliver the App's features (for example, storing your profile information or processing a support request) and do not use it for advertising, sharing, or distribution to third parties beyond what is described in the Privacy Policy. If you wish to remove any information you have provided, you can do so through the App or by contacting [support@fithub-app.com](mailto:support@fithub-app.com).

## 6. Health and Safety Disclaimer

FitHub offers fitness tracking and informational tools. It does not provide medical advice or diagnoses. Consult a physician before starting any exercise program. Use the App at your own risk and discontinue use if you experience pain, dizziness, or other concerning symptoms.

## 7. Acceptable Use

You agree not to:

- Reverse engineer, decompile, or tamper with the App;
- Use the App for commercial purposes without our written consent;
- Upload malware or interfere with the App’s operation;
- Attempt unauthorized access to other accounts or systems;
- Misuse data obtained through the App.

## 8. Third-Party Services and Links

The App may integrate with third-party services (e.g., payment processors) or contain links to external sites. Those services are governed by their own terms and privacy policies. FitHub is not responsible for their content, availability, or practices.

## 9. Intellectual Property

FitHub, the FitHub logo, and associated marks are trademarks of FitHub. The App and its content are owned by FitHub or its licensors and protected by intellectual property laws. We grant you a limited, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App for personal, non-commercial purposes.

## 10. Termination and Suspension

We may suspend or terminate your access if you violate these Terms, misuse the App, or if we believe it is necessary to protect the App or its users. You may stop using the App and request account deletion at any time. Sections 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, and 12 survive termination.

## 11. Disclaimer of Warranties

The App is provided “as is” and “as available.” FitHub disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, accuracy, or uninterrupted availability.

## 12. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, FitHub is not liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, or special damages arising out of your use of the App. Our total liability for direct damages is limited to the greater of (a) the amounts you paid for Premium in the past 12 months or (b) $50.

## 13. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold FitHub, its affiliates, and employees harmless from claims, damages, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from your use of the App or your violation of these Terms.

## 14. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California, excluding conflict-of-law rules. Any dispute will be resolved through binding arbitration in San Francisco County under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. You waive class actions and agree to individual arbitration, except you may pursue claims in small claims court.

## 15. Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms over time. Material changes will be communicated through the App or via email. Continued use after updates constitutes acceptance.
