## 1. Overview

FitHub (“we,” “us,” or “our”) operates the FitHub mobile application and related services (“App”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard information when you use the App. By using the App, you agree to the practices described here. If you do not agree, discontinue use.

## 2. Information We Collect

- **Account Information:** name, email address, profile photo, or similar identifiers you provide when creating or updating your account.
- **Support Communications:** messages you send to our support channels or feedback forms.
- **Payment Information:** if you purchase a subscription, payment details are processed by our payment processors; we store limited transaction metadata such as purchase date, plan type, and receipt identifiers.

We **do not** collect fitness or health data, usage analytics, location data, or information through cookies or similar tracking technologies.

## 3. How We Use Information

We use collected data to:

- Provide, personalize, and maintain the App;
- Process subscription payments and manage your membership;
- Communicate with you about account changes, service updates, and support requests;
- Enforce our Terms of Service and protect against fraud or misuse;
- Comply with legal obligations.

## 4. Sharing and Disclosure

We share information only as needed with:

- **Service Providers:** cloud hosting, customer support tools, and subscription/payment processors—each bound by confidentiality obligations;
- **Business Transfers:** mergers, acquisitions, or asset sales (with advance notice where feasible);
- **Legal Compliance:** responding to lawful requests or protecting users’ rights and safety.

We do not sell personal information. Aggregated or anonymized data may be shared for business or analytics purposes where permitted.

## 5. Data Retention

We retain personal data while your account remains active or as needed to provide the App and meet legal obligations. You can request deletion at any time; we may keep limited records required for audits, dispute resolution, or law.

## 6. Your Choices and Rights

- Access, update, or delete your account through the App or by contacting [support@fithub-app.com](mailto:support@fithub-app.com).
- Opt out of marketing emails using the unsubscribe link in any message.
- Residents in certain regions (e.g., EU, California) may have additional rights such as data portability or limiting processing.

## 7. Security

We maintain technical and organizational safeguards (e.g., encryption in transit, restricted access). No security measure is flawless; report suspected issues to [security@fithub-app.com](mailto:security@fithub-app.com).

## 8. Children’s Privacy

The App may be used by individuals of any age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 without verifiable parental consent. If you are a parent or guardian and believe we have collected information from a child under 13 without consent, contact us at [privacy@fithub-app.com](mailto:privacy@fithub-app.com) so we can review, update, or delete the data. We take reasonable steps to protect the privacy of younger users and comply with applicable child privacy laws.

## 9. International Transfers

If you access the App outside the United States, your data may be transferred to, stored in, and processed in the U.S. or other countries with different data-protection laws.
